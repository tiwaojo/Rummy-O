Deposit your design artifacts in this folder. These would be your architecture that includes the components of your design and the associations
among the components. Also include any behaviour models such as sequence and state diagrams.
Note: These would have been defined in Labs 3 & 4.

LAB 3

Lab 3 Involved The the us of the requirements and Use Cases from Labs 1&2 for our project and defined
a Software Architecture Conceptual Model.
The Models in this Lab included:
- Class diagrams of varying complexity
The Tables included:
- a noun table to find the classes
- a table to describe the classes and their responsibilities

LAB4

Lab 4  focuses on interaction and state models that are used to capture the dynamic behavior of a software system.
The Models for this Lab included:
- 2 sequence diagrams to desribe the system level design and one for a class level design
- A state Diagram to describe different states of the game
