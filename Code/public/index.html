            Rummy-O is a tile game similar to the rummy card game. Two to four players can play the game. There are 4
            sets of tiles distinguished by four different colors. There are 13 tiles for each colour numbered from 1 to
            13. The tile deck also contains 2 jokers.
            In total then they are 54 tiles in the game. Shuffle the tiles Lay all the tiles face down on the table, and
            shuffle them around thoroughly. Select the starter Each player selects a tile from the shuffled mix. The
            players with the lowest tile
            play first. The order of play rotates clockwise from the beginning player. Hand out the tiles Replace the
            beginner selection tiles, and shuffle the tiles again. Each player then selects 14 tiles. These tiles should
            be kept shielded from the
            other players. Make initial melds Before players may put tiles on the table, they must make melds that equal
            at least 25 points in one or more sets. One option for a meld is a run of three consecutive tiles in the
            same color, such as 10, 11
            and 12 in blue. The other option is three of the same number in different colors. The number on the tile
            equals the amount of points it is worth. The meld must come from the tiles in the player's hand. (Note: The
            joker tile can take on any
            value and color) SOFE 2720 Project Description Jan 2020 Author: Dr. Ramiro Liscano Try to eliminate tiles
            The object of the game is to eliminate all the tiles in a player's hand first. This is achieved by making
            runs and sets or by adding
            to other runs and sets on the table. For instance, if on the table there is a set of three 10s, another
            player may place a fourth 10 down. If no play can be made during a turn, the player has to pick a tile.
            Re-melding tiles Tiles on the board
            can be moved about and re-melded. The main motivation in doing is for a player to be able to play a tile
            from their hand. For example, if on the table there is a set of four 10s and a player has two tens of a
            different color in his/her hand
            they can use one of the tens in the board to create a set. Tiles on the board can be re-melded in any way as
            long as the end result are valid runs and sets. (Note: Jokers cannot be moved to other melds. They keep
            their value once they are
            played on the board) Replacing the Jokers A Joker that has been played on the board can be used by a player
            if they have the tile that the Joker represents in their hand. This tile is swapped with the Joker. The
            Joker was be played during
            that playerâ€™s turn. (Note: For sets of 3 tiles that include a Joker, the Joker can represent either of the 2
            missing tile colors in the set. For example, for a set consisting of a blue 10, red 10, and a Joker, the
            Joker can be replaced with
            a black or yellow 10 and reused by the player as any other tile)
