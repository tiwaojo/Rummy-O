In this file you should give an overview of the software product and links to the different artifacts in your repository.
It is somewhat like a table of contents with the addition of a product overview.
This is the entry point for the grading of the project. 
If you can also have a link to the execution of the code that would be great but not a requirement.
This is possible by leveraging the GitHub Actions Node.js functionality (I am assuming that your project is leveraging Node.js)

## Objective
Rummy-O (or Rummikub) is a multiplayer game where each player is to create either a sets three tiles bearing the same figure in different colors, or sets of runsâ€”three consecutive numbers in the same color. The first player to place all the tiles on their rack on the table wins. (<a href="techcrunch.com">techcrunch.com</a>)


## Requirements
The stakeholders needs and requirements, initially from lab 1. We were tasked with firstly choosing who was responsible for which roles for both rounds. These roles were then tasked with developing needs and requirements, as well as constraints for our Rummy-O web application. Following this a set of scenarios were designed to properly present the requirements for the project. These requirements were listed utilizing the Visual Paradigm software.

## Use Cases



## Design
**Lab 3**
The Design allowed us to develop our project and define a Software Architecture Conceptual Model using the requirements and use cases from Labs 1&2. The Models in this Lab included:

1. Class diagrams of varying complexity The Tables included:
2. Noun table to find the classes
3. A table to describe the classes and their responsibilities

**Lab 4**
Lab 4 allowed us to focus on interaction and state models(behaviours) that are used to capture the dynamic behavior of a software system. The Models for this Lab included:

1. 2 sequence diagrams to desribe the system level design and one for a class level design
2. A state Diagram to describe different states of the game
